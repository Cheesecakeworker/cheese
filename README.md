# Slimy landing by cheesecake factory
A platformer game inspired by Mario

Accidentely crashng into earth and getting an arm caught in the jammed ejecting 
mechanisim while escaping from your ship that was buring up from the entrance into earths atmosphere.......

while falling you looked around only to see the pieces of your melting ship fly past you,but these 
moments of consciousness was short lived.

Shortly after the shock subsided,you finnaly felt the pain from 
your shoulder witch no longer had a arm.the intense pain caused you to lose comsciousness again.

After a while......
you woke up and checked you and the area around you.you look around only to see a empty land with a 
flattned sign burried in the ground.You slowly stood up to view a blob like
creature.You picked up a pieace of broken metal from your surroundings to defend yourself before
approching the creature.it moved quite quickly even without legs and also possesed atlest some amount of 
inteligence  due to them being able to turn away when the reach the edge of a floating island.you saw one 
approching you at a moderate pace you reached out your remaining arm equppied with a metal stick to check it 
of its hostility.the moment the stick touched the blob.the blob started to grab the stick and pulled it with 
all its might.

Surprised,you accidentaly loosend your grinp and droped the stick.the slime devoured the stick as 
as soon as it hit the ground.you jump back having gotten your answer and ran back to your crashsite.on the 
way back you picked up a yellow coin the size of a palm.after you had rushed back,you analized the 
coin and found that they coin and found that it had a large amount of rare metals and common materials 
inside.you knew that it was possible to fix the remaments of your ship if you had a large amont of these coins.
Afterknowing you used the coin you picked up to make a basic gun and went off find more coins to repair you 
ship in this hostile blob creature filled land.
